# Project Name

## Description

Project description.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## How to Run the Application

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd back
   ```
2. Run the Python application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd front
   ```
2. Install the dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Notes

- Ensure the backend is running before starting the frontend.
- The frontend will typically run on `http://localhost:3000`, and the backend will run on a different port (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with missing dependencies, run `npm install` in the `front` directory or ensure all Python dependencies are installed for the backend.
